# Missing Features for MemeStaking Contract Integration

## üîß Critical Implementation Gaps

### 1. **Smart Contract Integration Layer**
```typescript
// Need to add: Contract service layer
- Contract ABI import
- Ethers.js/Web3.js integration  
- Contract instance management
- Error handling for contract calls
```

### 2. **IPFS Integration** 
```typescript
// Required for submitMeme(ipfsHash)
- IPFS upload service (Pinata/Infura/Web3.Storage)
- Generate IPFS hash from uploaded file
- Store metadata (title, description) on IPFS
- Return hash for contract submission
```

### 3. **Missing Contract Function Integrations**

#### Upload Page:
- [ ] `submitMeme(ipfsHash)` - Submit meme to current contest
- [ ] `hasUserSubmittedInCurrentContest()` - Check submission status
- [ ] Contest validation before submission

#### Explore/Stake Pages:
- [ ] `stakeMeme(memeId)` with ETH value - Actual staking
- [ ] `isMemeStakeable(memeId)` - Check stake delay
- [ ] `getMeme(memeId)` - Get real meme data from contract

#### Dashboard:
- [ ] `getUserMemes(address)` - Get user's submitted memes
- [ ] `getUserStakedMemes(address)` - Get user's stakes  
- [ ] `withdrawStake(memeId)` - Withdraw stake functionality
- [ ] `getUserStake(memeId, address)` - Get stake amounts

#### Contest System:
- [ ] `getCurrentContest()` - Show current contest info
- [ ] Contest countdown timer
- [ ] Contest end/start notifications
- [ ] `getContestWinner(contestId)` - Show previous winners

### 4. **Real-Time Data Integration**
```typescript
// Replace mock data with contract state
- Load memes from contract events (MemeSubmitted)
- Calculate real stake amounts and rankings
- Show actual reward distributions
- Live contest status updates
```

### 5. **Missing UI Components**

#### Stake Management:
- [ ] Withdraw stake button (only before contest ends)
- [ ] Stake amount input with validation
- [ ] Current stake display per meme
- [ ] Stake confirmation modal

#### Contest Features:
- [ ] Current contest timer/status banner
- [ ] Contest rules and timing display
- [ ] "Waiting for next contest" state
- [ ] Contest history/previous winners

#### Reward System:
- [ ] Claimable rewards display
- [ ] Reward history (RewardDistributed events)
- [ ] Batch reward claiming progress
- [ ] Platform fee display

### 6. **Admin Features (if applicable)**
- [ ] Contest ending controls (`endContest()`)
- [ ] Platform configuration updates
- [ ] Emergency pause functionality
- [ ] Fee collection management

### 7. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
```typescript
// Contract-specific error handling
- MEV protection messages
- Contest timing validations  
- Minimum stake amount checks
- Gas limit protections
- Insufficient balance handling
```

### 8. **Event Listening & Updates**
```typescript
// Listen to contract events for real-time updates
- MemeSubmitted events
- StakeAdded events  
- RewardDistributed events
- ContestEnded events
- Update UI automatically
```

## üéØ Priority Implementation Order

1. **High Priority**: Contract connection & basic read functions
2. **High Priority**: IPFS integration for meme uploads
3. **High Priority**: Real staking functionality with ETH transactions
4. **Medium Priority**: Stake withdrawal & contest timing
5. **Low Priority**: Admin features & advanced error handling

## üìä Current Status: ~15% Complete
- ‚úÖ UI Framework & Design
- ‚úÖ Wallet Connection  
- ‚ùå Contract Integration (0%)
- ‚ùå IPFS Integration (0%)
- ‚ùå Real Transactions (0%)

The frontend is essentially a **static prototype** that needs full Web3 integration to work with the MemeStaking contract.
